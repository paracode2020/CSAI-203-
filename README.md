# PDF Comparison App

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** PDF Comparison App  
**Description:**  
The PDF Comparison App is a web-based tool designed to help users upload PDF files, extract structured data, and compare different versions of similar documents by visualizing the differences using charts or graphs. This tool is intended for industries that require tracking document changes over time, such as contracts, reports, or regulatory documents.

## Goals
The main objective of the PDF Comparison App is to create an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly platform for:
- Uploading and storing PDF files.
- Extracting and storing structured data from PDFs.
- Comparing and visualizing differences between document versions.
